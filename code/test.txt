Does anybody know if the Boarding Pass Ryanair must have the number of ID card (passenger) even you are from European Country. I just check in and print the boarding pass but the ID card number is not visible.Do you think this is a problem ?

I'm traveling Economy to Thailand this summer on Asiana. Our long haul segments are ORD > ICN and ICN > JFK. Am I reading this chart correctly that I could upgrade to business for 40k miles per segment? I currently have 20k miles and US Airways is offering 50% bonus right now to buy. So I could buy 75k miles for $500. If I did this for my wife and I, that would give us 170k miles. At 40k per segment, we could upgrade to to business for the 14 hour flights for $1000. Seems well worth it. usairways.com/pv_obj_cache/pv_obj_id_67504E1â€¦ Am I missing something? What would you do to verify this is correct before I purchase the miles? Do I call US Airways or Asiana? Thanks!
The question is why are all suitcases on the market these days flimsy soft and zipped ? ! ? Edited: 4:15 pm, September 20, 2012
 I inform the staff member (Ms Ragdish) that i have no desire to check it, but will it be taken off me. She asks me to present it for weighing - and as it weighs 11KG she says I must pay 40Â£ to check it. I offered to take something out but she stated that then my laptop case would be over weight. So I had to pay 40Â£ to have a suitcase taken off me that would have been taken off me anyway.  Can I ask the question of Aer Lingus - If you try to emulate his failed baggage policy, could I implore you to try and at least aim for his successful on time policy? 
Hi, I'm flying to Melbourne (WT) end of April, via Hong Kong with BA. A couple of people have told me that there is not much point in pre booking a seat, as being a solo female, I am likely to have the seat changed and be seated next to unaccompanied minors. This seems a bit bonkers and presumptious, to me. Is this even a likely scenario? (After all I could be any sort of weirdo) If not, could I have comments re seat 48C All I want seat wise is an aisle seat that reclines. Not fussy about anything else, as it is a night flight and am hoping to snooze for a few hours.
IÂ´m leaving tomorrow from Buenos Aires to Paris, then IÂ´ll travel to London and back to Paris to return to Buenos Aires. When departing from Buenos Aires I have to pay a u$s 18 airport fee. Will I have to pay an airport fee at CDG and Heathrow as well?

We are flying to Germany in 2011, either into Munich or Frankfurt, (would prefer Munich but we may not have a choice using the Lufthansa flyer miles).

 We are flying with our baby on Ryanair. You can take a buggy to the plane stairs. However we have a buggy that the carseat attaches to. Can we take this as one item to the plane stairs or would they make us take it apart and check in the car seat? 
I have just been pre booking my Mum disability assistance at LHR with BA and her special in flight meal. I then found shehadn't completed the API and did that for her. I asked whether she had her ESTA - what's that, she replied! I explained that the last time she travelled she completed a green card on board, but now this requires an electronic application before boarding. What would have happened if my Mum had not known about this and turned up at LHR? Would she be able to fly, but then be refused entry at Immigration in US? Just interested in what if ...!

On 747-400 where is the personel IFE situated for seats next to the exit doors? I see that the tray tables are in the armrests but no mention on the IFE.
Regarding above I have gone online and checked in and only outbound boarding passes were available to print. This is our first time with Ryanair is this the normal procedure or do I have to have a return boarding pass??. If so how do I get it and were from. If you have experience of this could you please inform me !!
HI I am flying from Tampa intl airport to Chennai via Chicago ORD and London LHR,by BA. Is it necessary to check-in your baggage at Chicago ORD?
especially if you connect through Philly. I flew from Phx July 2009 summer and had major issues through PHL both directions. I should have paid more for the BA non-stop. Lesson learned. I'll try to keep this brief. Phx-PHL leg uneventful. Got to PHL and checked in at gate and big problem. They had to downsize the aircraft from a 767 to a 757 and were asking volunteers to give up seats. I had a HUGE event plannd in London next night I could not give my seat up. Finally they had enough volunteers and they tried to split me and my freind up. I said no way she is elderly and can barely walk and needs assistance with everything so they put us back together. Got to LHR safely. Had great trip. Flight back..huge overbook and again asking for volunteers, at least no aircraft downgrade. Left almost on time, not 1 seat to spare. Got to PHL and sat on runway for almost an hour no open gates. I had to reclaim my bag, go through security again, ran with my carryon and laptop to the gate and missed the jet by 5 minutes. I had to stay the night without any of my bags they had already been checked. No clean clothes, nothing. All toiletries sitting in Phx. Got small care package from airline with toothbrush, shampoo thats it. Cell phone dead because charger in suitcase. Lesson learned...pack some clothes and necessties in carryon in case you get stuck, and fly non stop if available.
 Europe-Mexico (Round trip) is 50% cheaper than same flight, but trip starting in Mexico. This applies to all major airlines. (example MEX-MUC vs MUC-MEX) Since my trip starts in Mexico, I pay 50% more to visit my family in Europe than they pay to fly to visit me! Any way to avoid this madness?
The flight itinerary is Seattle-Chicago-Zurich with the Seattle-Chicago leg on United and Chicago-Zurich leg on Swiss. I wanted to purchase from United but fly Swiss for the transatlantic.I have the Swiss confirmation number from the United web site, but, when I go to the Swiss site, I am apparently not allowed to see or manage the Swiss segments on the Swiss website due to the codeshare. I could use some enlightenment on the process for online check-in on both outbound and return flights and seat selection for the Swiss legs so your input much appreciated.  am still a bit inexperienced with codeshares. 
 just wondered if anyone has travelled on this airline? Myself and my son are travelling to Australia for christmas just wondered what they were like?  I have looked at the website for royal brunei but not much on it don't even know which plane were on!! Thanks in advance Corrina
I'm travelling to Sydney, stopping at Duabi for 3 hours. I need to take my 2 inhalers with me,  They're still in the boxes as they're unopened which has my name, date of issue and the doctors surgery, address etc. Is that suitable for security checks in both Dubai and Sydney. 
Hi, I could do with some advice on booking flights and travel for a fortnight in South Africa in August '11. First the long haul flights from London. It seems like decades since I booked a flight to anywhere except Europe or the USA so I am not up to date. My fellow traveller is pretty much convinced we should get down to the nearest London travel agent or click on South African Airways right away (January), on the grounds that tickets will go up or flights sell out. Then it's done. I reckon it could be worth waiting a bit. Do air fare prices drop significantly? Is it too early to hunt for a better deal, and what are the best search engines and web sites to check? How long should I wait? Secondly, any advice on internal flights or other transport from Cape Town to Jo'burg? We plan a few days in CT and then go on to Kruger National Park. There is no way, incidentally, that we are going to wait until the last minute and hope for a cut price deal a week before departure. No way. Absolutely no way no matter how much cheaper. For the sake of my sanity if nothing else, this whole thing including booking internal flights, car hire, accommodation and safari lodge all has to be done pretty soon! Thanks, Mike
